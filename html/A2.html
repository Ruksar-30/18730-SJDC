    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.</p>
